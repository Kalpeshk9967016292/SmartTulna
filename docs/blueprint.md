## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933), representing courage and sacrifice, integral to Indian culture, yet desaturated to feel contemporary.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAF9F6), providing a neutral and clean backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Emerald Green (#3D84A8), an analogous color to the primary, chosen for its strong contrast, freshness and auspicious associations.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.  'Poppins' has a contemporary, precise, fashionable look, while 'PT Sans' provides excellent readability for the body.
- Mobile-first approach, responsive grid layout using TailwindCSS, ensuring adaptability across various devices. Product cards will have collapsible sections.
- Use of subtle animations to indicate loading and confirm user actions
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions to improve the user experience.
